# CocoonDrop
CocoonDrop is a sleek, interactive multi-stage payload obfuscator built for CTFs, red teamers, and adversarial simulation creators.  It takes your raw PowerShell payloads, encrypts them, hides them in Catbox, stages them through obfuscated links, compiles them into executable DLLs, and lets you inject, deploy, or drop them via PowerShell
